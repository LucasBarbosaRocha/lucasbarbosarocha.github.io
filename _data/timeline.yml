  description: My experiences at PET Sistemas were as follows. The first project I worked on was a research study on Software Registration (05/2015 - 07/2015), 
               and the main challenge was understanding how software registration works in Brazil. One of the primary activities I was involved in was as a
               teaching assistant fot programming courses, helping with exercise grading, creating exercise lists, and answering student questions like a Teaching Assistant 
               in the course Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming I (03/2015 - 06/2015), Teaching Assistant in Algorithms and Programming (08/2016 - 12/2016), 
               and Teaching Assistant in Algorithms and Programming (03/2017 - 08/2017). I spent one month assisting with the configuration of Redmine on Ubuntu Server 
               (10/2015). Finally, the most challenging task was working on the maintenance of a laboratory cluster, covering both hardware and software aspects, 
               including the installation and maintenance of Rocks Cluster (2016-2017).

  description: I worked as a teaching assistant in a project called DESTACOM, led by professors from FACOM-UFMS. This project aims to teach logic and programming to students 
               from public and private schools. Its motto is CS Unplugged, meaning Teaching Computing without a Computer. In the first part of the project, students 
               learn concepts without needing a computer. Then, a programming language is introduced, with Python being the chosen language. Teaching assistants support 
               the professors in class and help students with any questions.
