  description: The project DESTACOM was conducted by some professors from FACOM-UFMS and aims to teach programming logic and programming to students from public and private schools. The motto is "CS Unplugged," which means "Teaching Computing without a computer." In the first part of the project, students learn the concepts without the need for a computer. Then, a programming language is taught, with Python being the chosen one. Monitors accompany the teachers during classes and assist the students in case of doubts.

               I was a software developer at the consulting company Canopus, based in Rio Grande do Sul, currently assigned to Akross in Rio de Janeiro. 
               My main focus is on Java development (Spring Boot and Quarkus) for solutions that leverage AWS resources such as DynamoDB, S3, SQS, SNS, 
               Step Functions, and EventBridge. I worked on developing and enhancing microservices to support offer contracting demands for customers from Claro. 
               In addition to Java, we use Go for some microservices and Python for developing lambdas and scripts. Our worked environment also includes 
               Bitbucket Pipelines for deploying new application versions. In terms of software architecture, we are migrating from an MVC approach to 
               a hexagonal architecture. Our services are still evolving in this regard as we continue to deepen our understanding of this new architecture.
